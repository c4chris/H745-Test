# H745-Test

This is inspired from LTDC_Display_2Layers LTDC Display 2 layers example for STM32H745I_DISCO

- M4 will blink LD8 once per second

- M7 will display and move 2 copies of a sample image on the LTDC display (and blink another LED too)

The image was created in GIMP and exported from GIMP as a C source file
